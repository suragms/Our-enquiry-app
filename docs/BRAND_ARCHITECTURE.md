# HexaStack Brand Architecture

## Master Brand

- **Public display name:** HEXASTACK SOLUTIONS (all caps for logo/header; sentence case "HexaStack Solutions" in body copy)
- **Legal name:** HexaStack Solutions (same as display; used in footer, contracts, and official correspondence)
- **Do not use:** "AI Solutions" on logo, hero, or primary navigation. Brand must read as a global SaaS product company, not an IT services agency.

## Product Sub-Brands

| Product | Positioning |
|---------|-------------|
| **HexaBill** | Complete Business Management Software — invoicing, POS, inventory, multi-branch |
| **HexaCV** | Free ATS Resume Builder — privacy-first, no login required |
| **Hexa AI Tool Suite** | Career Optimization Tools — ATS checker, JD analyzer, bullet improver, etc. |

Naming is consistent: "Hexa" prefix, clear product name. No "AI Solutions" in product taglines.

## Positioning Statement

HexaStack builds software that helps businesses and professionals run and grow — from billing and operations (HexaBill) to career optimization (HexaCV and Hexa AI Tool Suite). We focus on clarity, compliance, and outcomes for India, the Gulf, and global markets.

## Mission

To deliver reliable, modern software that simplifies operations and accelerates careers — so businesses and individuals can focus on what matters.

## Vision

To be the go-to platform for SMBs and professionals in our target markets: one brand, multiple products that work together.

## Core Values

- **Clarity** — Simple UX and transparent pricing
- **Compliance** — VAT- and region-aware where it matters
- **Privacy** — User data is not the product (especially HexaCV)
- **Reliability** — Systems that scale and stay up

## Brand Voice & Tone

- **Traits:** Confident, clear, helpful, professional without being corporate
- **Do:** Use short sentences. Lead with benefits. Be specific (numbers, regions, use cases)
- **Don’t:** Overuse jargon, hype, or vague “AI-powered” without explaining value

## Target Audience Segmentation

| Segment | Geography | Focus |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **India** | India | SMBs and enterprises for HexaBill; job seekers and professionals for HexaCV / AI tools. Local compliance and language where relevant. |
| **Gulf** | UAE, Saudi Arabia, GCC | VAT-compliant billing (HexaBill), multi-branch, inventory. English-first; Arabic considerations later. |
| **Global** | English-speaking | SaaS positioning, scalability, privacy (HexaCV), career tools. |

All product and site copy should align with this architecture. Use "HEXASTACK" in the main logo and nav; use "HexaStack Solutions" only in the footer and legal line.
